              <p class="card-text"><strong> <br>Hello, my name is Yosabet Kassie. <br> I am an international student from Ethiopia<br> and I go to school at San Fransisco State University. <br> 
                I am majoring in Computer Engineering.<br> I chose this career path because I like solving problems <br> 
               I belive my love for Math is what made me choose to become a Computer Engineer. <br> I never had experiance with any type of programming until my third semester in collage.<br>
               It was hard at first, but I was able to understand it thanks to the help I got from my friends.<br> 
               Now I am looking forward to advancing my knowledge in programming and engineering.</strong></p>
